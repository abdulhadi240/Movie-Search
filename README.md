# Movie-Search
A web project that utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to search for movies and retrieve detailed information about them would be a valuable tool for film enthusiasts. The website would have a search bar where users could enter the name of the movie they are looking for. Upon submitting their query, the website would use JavaScript to fetch data from a movie database API such as IMDb or Rotten Tomatoes. The data would then be displayed in a visually appealing manner using CSS. The information retrieved could include the movie's title, release year, rating, synopsis, cast, crew, and more. The user could then browse through the results and click on a particular movie to view its detailed information. The project would provide a convenient way for users to find and learn more about movies they are interested in.
